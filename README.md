# ADHD Ally

## About

ADHD Ally aims to support children aged 3 to 17 years with ADHD in the United States. We accomplish this by connecting these individuals with ADHD support groups and professionals. We also provide state-level statistics about ADHD to raise awareness about the condition.

Integrating the disparate data sources offers significant insights into the ADHD community within children aged 3 to 17 years. This includes understanding the prevalence of ADHD in young children at the state level in addition to identifying the optimal support strategies for those affected. Key learnings include the critical need for a comprehensive support system, combining support groups with professional advice, and the value of tailored care, leveraging both state statistics and advice from local professionals.
